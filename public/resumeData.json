    "bio": "I am an AI/ML engineer and Computer Engineering graduate student at New York University. At Stardog Union, I integrated the CARTE ML system into Voicebox3, built an automated scoring framework, engineered a 100M+ row graph-ingestion pipeline, and optimized lineage and inference performance for LangChain and PyTorch Geometric workloads. I previously shipped React features and tests for client sites at Cabbagesoft Technologies and delivered GPU-accelerated air-quality research at Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-Informatics. I love designing reliable AI agents, scalable data workflows, and intuitive user experiences that turn complex ideas into results.",
