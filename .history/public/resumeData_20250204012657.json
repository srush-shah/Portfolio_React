    "bio": "Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a Master of Engineering student majoring in Computer Engineering at New York University in the Big Apple. I have been learning to code since Grade 11 and know various programming languages like C, C++, JavaScript, PHP and Python. Frontend Web Development has been one of my major interests, and I have worked with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, MaterialUI, React.js and NodeJS to build personal projects as well as for internship projects and interview tasks. Furthermore, I have managed to learn C#, .NET framework, and Visual Studio 2019 to build a desktop project as part of my internship with Space Applications Center, ISRO. Being an enthusiast for Artificial Intelligence, I strive to dive deep into the field and bring my ideas to life. Currently, I am taking up some intersting courses like Deep Learning, ML Systems Engineering and Operation, and Data Science for Business under some of the coolest professors! It would be right to call me a nerd, as I am ever-ready to code or read a book. After an exhausting day of work or study, I revitalize by enjoying mystery thriller books and Bollywood songs that incorporate Indian classical music.",
