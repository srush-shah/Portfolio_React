    "bio": "Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a Master of Engineering student majoring in Computer Engineering at . I have been learning to code since Grade 11 and know various programming languages like C, C++, JavaScript, PHP and Python. Frontend Web Development has been one of my major interests, and I have worked with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, MaterialUI, React.js and NodeJS to build personal projects as well as for internship projects and interview tasks. Furthermore, I have managed to learn C#, .NET framework, and Visual Studio 2019 to build a desktop project as part of my internship with Space Applications Center, ISRO. Being an enthusiast for Artificial Intelligence, I strive to dive deep into the field and bring my ideas to life. Currently, I am applying for a degree of Master of Science in Computer Science with an aim to specialize in Artificial Intelligence in the United States. It would be right to call me a nerd, as I am ever-ready to code or read a book. After an exhausting day of work or study, I revitalize by enjoying mystery thriller books and Bollywood songs that incorporate Indian classical music.",
